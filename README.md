# Introduction
This project is created as a workaround for myself to be able to get the data that I'm following from [Jitta](https://www.jitta.com) easily. I do not have the patience nor the interest to write this into a full fledged program. If you are interseted, feel free to fork this and make it better. 


# Installation
## Windows
1. Download [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/). I recommend WAMP for the ease of setup. You could also install and configure [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) + [PHP](https://secure.php.net/downloads.php) manually if that's your thing.
2. [Download jitta2csv](https://github.com/chuaweijie/jitta2csv/archive/master.zip)
3. Unzip jitta2csv-master.zip or whatever zip file that has been downloaded. 
4. Move the folder named jitta2csv-master inside the unzipped folder into the www folder inside your WAMP installation. 

## Mac
1. Download [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/). I recommend MAMP for the ease of setup. You could also install and configure [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) + [PHP](https://secure.php.net/downloads.php) manually if that's your thing.
2. [Download jitta2csv](https://github.com/chuaweijie/jitta2csv/archive/master.zip)
3. Unzip jitta2csv-master.zip or whatever zip file that has been downloaded. 
4. Move the folder named jitta2csv-master inside the unzipped folder into the htdocs folder inside your MAMP installation. 


# Usage
1. Please refer [jitta2csv wiki for usage](https://github.com/chuaweijie/jitta2csv/wiki).
